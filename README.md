# CUESDK.NET
This is a simple 1:1 wrapper for the Corsair CUESDK. All function calls available in the native SDK are available in this wrapper.

All classes and enums are under the Corsair.CUE.SDK namespace and the functions available in the native SDK are in the CUESDK class.

The native library (CUESDK.dll) in both x64 and x86 variants are packaged with the nuget package https://www.nuget.org/packages/CUESDK.NET just add a reference inside your project and that should be all thats needed.

PR's are open! If you see some room for improvement please feel free to open an issue or submit a PR.
